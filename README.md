# simplex_method
A python application that solves Linear Programming and Integer Linear Programming using the simplex method (only big m, but two phases method will be added soon).
It uses kivy for a very responsive easy to use gui, openpyxl to export the results into xslx format and antlr to simulate the behavior of M (because why not).

# Packages/frameworks needed
- kivy (1.10.0)
- openpyxl
- antlr4
